# qvfs unit

*Quick Virtual File System* is something I originally built as a teen in QBASIC, although slightly different, but similar in concept and simplicity.

It uses a basic structure which is stored in memory as a literal array of pointers when a VFS file is read in, and can be committed back to disk.

It is meant as a simple way to store very basic data in a structured manner.  I am currently working on a modern version of this which uses modern practices for storage, as now PCs are extremely fast, this simple format is no longer needed for performance.
