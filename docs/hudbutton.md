# hudbutton unit

Install `klibLaz` into your Lazarus IDE to add `HUD` to your component palette.

You can then take the `HUDButton` component and drop it onto any Lazarus form.  It should work on every supported LCL platform.  It works like a regular button, except it might be easier to touch on a touch screen display.
