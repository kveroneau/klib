# ecweather unit

To be used in my future Home Automation System code.  This unit is currently hardcoded to Calgary Weather from *Environment Canada* and is very specific.  I doubt many Canadians other than myself use either *ObjectPascal* or *Lazarus* so unless a new issue or pull request to make it support any other location than Calgary, it will remain as such for the foreseeable future.

Basically, after importing the unit, the weather forecast will be cached in `weather_cache.weather` pointer.
