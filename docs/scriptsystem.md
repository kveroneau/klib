# ScriptSystem unit

A very basic character-based scripting system to be used in programs for end-user automation during runtime.  The idea of this scripting system was created in my teens around the time I created the `qvfs` idea, as a way to store small programs within the small confines of the VFS.  This allowed me to create and run basic programs from within my own program back then.

With this unit, I took that previous concept and turned it into a reusable class so it can be used in more applications if I need it.
