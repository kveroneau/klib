# kevshell unit

A port of my pure command-line based `KevShell` over to a LCL Component to be used in GUI programs for scripting and such.  After the package is installed into your Lazarus IDE, you should see `KevShell` in your component tab.

Currently it is just an easy way for me to personally add a KevShell to any GUI application if I need it, and it can run standard 6502 KevShell binaries.  It shouldn't be of any use to anybody else though.
