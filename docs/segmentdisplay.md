# SegmentDisplay unit

This was created during a huge update to how my HUD displays in my home looked, as I moved away from standard buttons and toggle buttons, I also wanted to change up how the actual clock display worked, and here is a LCL component which now anybody can use to add a simple 8-segment display to any LCL application with as easy as a simple drag and drop.
