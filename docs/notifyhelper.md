# notifyhelper unit

A unit I wrote way back in the day to assist with showing notifications from an application on my KDE Plasma Desktop.  The included python script `notify` should be placed somewhere else than inside this library to be used.

Personally I'd rather use the *D-Bus* interface via ObjectPascal, but last I looked at how it was done, it was much more complex than just using a simple python script.
